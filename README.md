# Language_Detection
The task of language detection comes into use when you are working on a very large dataset that contains data in different languages. Suppose you want to create an even driven program where the final output depends on the language which the user provides as an input. So it is important to first detect the language of the text provided by the user before taking any action. I will take you through the task of language detection with Python.

As an open-source programming language, Python provides libraries and packages for almost every possible task, as the Python programming community continues to contribute to Python with new libraries, packages, and modules. You can build your machine learning model for the language detection task, but for this article, I will be using the langdetect package in Python which can detect over 55 different languages within a few lines of code.

If you have never used this package before then you can easily install it by using the pip command; pip install langdetect.
